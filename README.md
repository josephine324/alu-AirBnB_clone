# HBnB üè®

HBnB is a comprehensive web application that combines various components such as database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing, all designed to replicate some functionalities of AirBnB.
Project to be done in teams of 2 people but for me it is different because my teammate is doing BEL

## Step 1 - The Console üïπÔ∏è

### Description

* Create your data model
* Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between ‚ÄúMy object‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow they are stored and persisted‚Äù. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won‚Äôt have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine


### Relevant Files And Directories

* `models:` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called ‚Äúmodel‚Äù in a OOP * project is the representation of an object/instance.
* `tests:` directory will contain all unit tests.
* `console.py:` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
* `models/base_model.py:` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements: .attributes: id, created_at and updated_at .methods: save() and to_json()
* `models/engine:` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.


### Using The Console

* `Run the console:` ./console.py
* `Quit the console:` (hbnb) quit
* `Display the help for a command:` (hbnb) help <command>
* `Show an object:` (hbnb) show <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.show(<id>)
* `Destroy an object:` (hbnb) destroy <class> <id> or (hbnb) <class>.destroy(<id>)
* `Show all objects, or all instances of a class:` (hbnb) all or (hbnb) all <class>
* `Update an attribute of an object:` (hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>" or (hbnb) <class>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, "<attribute value>")


### Examples 

#### Interactive Mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
===================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode:

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
==================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
==================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
